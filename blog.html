            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold"> 1. what is the difference between local storage and session storage ?</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg font-normal">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, The difference is that while data
                in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
                document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned
                to that particular tab.</p>

        <div>
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Define block scope and global scope.</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg font-normal">A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is
                declared outside all functions or curly braces ( { } ), it exists in the <span class="text-2xl">global
                    scope</span>. The
                global
                variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text-2xl">This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from
                    access by the
                    outside of the block.</span> The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.
                In order
                to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it.

            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">3.What is event loop in JavaScript ??</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg font-normal">The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the
                Callback Queue or Message Queue. <br>
                When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises...
                Then these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any.
                If they completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into
                message queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the
                call stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute it.

            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">4.What is undefined ??</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg font-normal"><span class="text-2xl">A variable that has not been assigned a
                    value is of
                    type
                    undefined.</span> A method
                or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned
                value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .
